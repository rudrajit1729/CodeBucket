## Why Data structures?
Writing programs is writing instructions and instructions are meaninggless without data. We process and manage data efficiently by structuring the data. This structuring of data often makes an algorithm faster and easier. Efficiency is achieved by either minimizing runtime of a program or by reducing the space occupied by a program. It is often difficult to achieve both of these attributes.

## What is Data structures?
For a simple explanation, A data structure is an arrangement or collection of data items so that these items can be managed easily and opeartions to be performed on these items become efficient. 

## What is included in this repository?
This repository contains programs written in C implementing a particular abstract data type in each file. Abstract data type is a program which includes a data structure and various operations that can be performed on it.
