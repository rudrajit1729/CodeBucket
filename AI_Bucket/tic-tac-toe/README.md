# About
The AI in this game was designed using the [minimax algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax). It is unbeatable.

# Suggested improvements
* I left the interface looking very minimalistic, because my focus was on the AI. Could use some polish.
* The AI is too fast for any visible change to the turn display during its turn.
* Having only an unbeatable AI feels a bit sadistic - a beatable version would be nice.
